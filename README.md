## To-dos before Wednesday 1/29/2020

- Download Anaconda and create an empty jupyter notebook

- Recall key programming tasks in MATH 347 Bayesian Statistics and think about what you need to know to complete these tasks with Python. Programming tasks include but not limited to: 

    - generate random draws from a known distribution
    - plot a graph with generated draws
    - write a loop
    - write a function
    - write a Gibbs sampler
    
- Create and maintain a jupyter notebook to record your progress
